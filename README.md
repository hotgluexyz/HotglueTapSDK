# Hotglue SDK for Taps

This is a fork of Melanto's SingerSDK for special use in [hotglue](https://hotglue.com), an embedded integration platform for running Singer Taps and Targets.

Taps and targets built on the SDK are automatically compliant with the
[Singer Spec](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/spec), the
de-facto open source standard for extract and load pipelines.
